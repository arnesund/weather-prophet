# Weather dataset analyzed with Prophet

This repository contains the dataset and Jupyter Notebook used in my exploration of Prophet:

## Updated dataset available

The CSV file "outdoor-temperature-hourly_20170710.csv" contains the full dataset with five more months of temperatures compared to "outdoor-temperature-hourly.csv". To make it possible to rerun the analysis and get the same results as I did in my blog post, the original dataset is retained unaltered as "outdoor-temperature-hourly.csv".
